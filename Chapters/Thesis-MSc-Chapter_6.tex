\section{Introduction}
% Challenge in children speech
As mentioned in Chapter \ref{chap:Chapter2}, the ongoing advancements in deep learning, coupled with the availability of extensive training datasets, have undeniably improved the \ac{ASR} performances. However, despite these remarkable advancements, the recognition of children's speech remains a domain where performance lags behind that achieved for adult speech. Children's speech introduces distinct challenges owing to its inherent variability influenced by age, linguistic development, and articulatory differences. Therefore, there is a growing need acquiring a sufficiently diverse and extensive dataset for training children's \ac{ASR} systems. 

However, practical constraints, including ethical considerations, privacy concerns, the high cost of data collection, the challenges posed by children's limited attention span and inconsistent adherence to prompts during reading tasks, hinder the creation of such datasets. In an effort to address this performance gap, researchers in \cite{asr-google} leveraged an in-house sizable dataset of children's speech, comparable in scale to an adult corpus, to train an \ac{ASR} model. The outcomes showcased state-of-the-art performances, emphasising the potential of \ac{ASR} systems to effectively learn from diverse and variable children's speech data when provided with a substantial amount of training data.

As an answer to the challenges of collecting real childen's speech data, an alternative strategy emerged, involving the generation of synthetic datasets using a \ac{TTS} model. \ac{TTS} offers a solution to bypass to the challenges associated with collecting and annotating real children's speech data. While some studies have explored the application of \ac{TTS} for \ac{ASR}, either through direct use of synthetic speech for training or as a form of data augmentation \cite{laptev2020you,fazel21_interspeech}, synthesising children's speech introduces a unique set of challenges. The inherent substandard and imprecise pronunciation in children's speech \cite{wang2021towards} poses an hurdle, raising concerns that the direct use of synthetic data may lead to a decrease in performance \cite{wang2021towards, hu2022synt++}.

% Our Approach
In this chapter, we introduce a novel technique known as ``Double-Way Adapter Tuning", or \ac{DWAT}, to enhance \ac{ASR} models specifically for children's speech, even in scenarios where imperfect data are employed as augmentation. Our approach involves the integration of additional Adapter modules into the existing \ac{ASR} model during the fine-tuning process. As demonstrated in the preceding chapter \ref{chap:5}, Adapters have proven to be efficient in transferring knowledge for children's speech, thereby serving as a parameter-efficient means of knowledge transfer. But also as a novel way to reduce the gap between a source and target domain while preserving the source knowledge in the pre-trained model.
Building upon the efficiency of Adapters in the realm of children's speech, we hypothesise that these Adapters can be used to mitigate the domain mismatch between real and synthetic data. We accomplish this through a two-step training procedure in a similar way as the methodology proposed in \cite{fan2022draft}.

In the initial step, the Adapters are exclusively trained using synthetic data, while the pre-trained model remains frozen. This phase enables the Adapters to specialise in handling the nuances introduced by synthetic data. Subsequently, in the second step, we perform fine-tuning, involving both the trained Adapters and the entire model weights. During this fine-tuning process, a combination of synthetic and real data is given to the model. Notably, our approach introduces a crucial distinction between synthetic and real data throughout the fine-tuning process. Synthetic data traverses the Adapter layers, allowing the synthetic characteristics to be handle by the Adapters while  still contribute to the full model tunning, while real data bypasses these Adapters. We hypothesise that this meticulous differentiation could enables the effective use of imperfect synthetic data, ultimately leading to an enhancement in \ac{ASR} performances.

In this chapter, our objective is to address the research questions: \textit{Is it possible to use children's synthetic speech to extend the amount of children's data? How can we control the quality and speakersâ€™ variability?}

\section{Enhancing ASR Performance through TTS Data Augmentation}
%\ac{TTS} data augmentation
The progression of \ac{TTS} systems, achieving human-like quality, presents a valuable avenue for effective \ac{TTS}-based data augmentation in \ac{ASR}. This approach, as exemplified in studies such as \cite{laptev2020you}, involves the generation of synthetic speech from text using \ac{TTS} models. The synthetic speech is then combined with real speech during the training process, leading to notable performance enhancements. Importantly, this approach is not limited to well-resourced tasks and has demonstrated success even in low-resource scenarios, as illustrated in \cite{casanova2022asr}. However, despite its efficacy, \ac{TTS}-based data augmentation offers only modest improvements, primarily owing to the persistent challenge of domain mismatch between synthetic and real speech, indeed, even with human-like quality, some generated utterances suffer artefacs or wrong modelisation. The inherent differences between the characteristics of synthetic and real speech limit the extent to which the benefits of \ac{TTS} augmentation as \ac{ASR} data augmentation. 

In order to mitigate the mismatch with real data and to reduce speaker dependency,  the use of discrete intermediate representations both shared by the \ac{TTS} and \ac{ASR} systems instead of Mel-scale filterbanks, obtained with a VQ-wav2vec, has been proposed in \cite{9688218}. This approach has demonstrated promising results. However, it is essential to note that implementing such a strategy necessitates training both the \ac{ASR} and \ac{TTS} systems from scratch. This requirement may pose challenges, particularly in the context of low-resource \ac{ASR} scenarios

% Children data selection
An alternative approach to address the domain mismatch between synthetic and real speech rely on data selection techniques, as proposed by \cite{wang2021towards}.  This approach focuses on selectively choosing high-quality synthetic speech data to mitigate the challenges associated with imperfect data augmentation. The data selection process ensures that only the most reliable and accurate synthetic speech samples are incorporated during the augmentation process. One advantageous aspect of this work is that it does not necessitate more complex training for the \ac{TTS} or \ac{ASR} system. Instead, it operates as an off-the-shelf selection on top of the \ac{TTS} system. This characteristic underscores the practicality and ease of it integration into existing \ac{TTS} systems.
In \cite{wang2021towards}, they demonstrated the effectiveness of employing i-vector speaker-embedding cosine similarity between reference and generated utterances as a metric for data selection. This metric was compared to other metrics such as error rate, acoustic posterior, and synthetic discriminator. 

% Synth++
More recently, \cite{hu2022synt++} introduced the Synth++ framework, which employs a similar data selection approach, called rejection sampling. This rejection sampling method relies on the output of a \ac{DNN}, which is trained on a 5-dimensional features vector derived from a pre-trained \ac{ASR} model. The goal of this \ac{DNN} is to discriminate either the data is real or synthetic. To this end, the 5-dimensional features vector for each utterances encompass \ac{CE} loss, \ac{CTC} loss, \ac{WER}, lengths of tokens in the predicted text and the length of tokens in the target text. In addition to rejection sampling, Synth++ introduces the use of separate batch normalisation for real and synthetic data. During the training process, when synthetic data is fed into the model, it undergoes distinct normalisation layers. The incorporation of this separated normalisation has been demonstrated to significantly reduce the mismatch between real and synthetic data during training, leading to notable improvements in \ac{WER} scores.

\section{Closing the synthetic and real mismatch gap with Adapters}

    \caption{Overview of ``Double way Adapter fine-tuning"  within th context of an Transformer model}
    \label{fig:overall}
\end{figure}

The effectiveness of Adapters in the existing literature for both speech and \ac{NLP} tasks has been well-documented \cite{pfeiffer, philip2020monolingual, mao-etal-2022-unipelt}. Additionally, the positive results detailed in Chapter \ref{chap:5}, where Adapter modules were proven effective for children's \ac{ASR}, underscore their pivotal role in mitigating the mismatch between a source model and a target task. Proving that Adapters are capable of capturing task-relevant information, while the frozen pre-trained model retains valuable insights about the source task.

In alignment with these findings, \cite{fan2022draft} introduced the \ac{Draft} for children's \ac{ASR}. The authors aimed to reduce the mismatch between adult and children speech data in SSL models by incorporating Adapters and an additional adaptation phase. Leading to improved performances.

Motivated by the successes of the \ac{Draft} framework and Synth++, our approach integrates Adapter modules as a substitute for the separate normalisation layers present in the Synth++ framework. Furthermore, we incorporate the multiple-step adaptation and the use of Adapters from the \ac{Draft} framework. Finally, we employed filtered synthetic data, implementing a speaker-embedding cosine similarity metric to retain synthetic utterances that exhibited high-quality generation as pproposed by previous work on data selection for \ac{TTS} data augmentation. This combination forms a novel strategy to address the domain mismatch in \ac{ASR} for children's speech, called \textit{\ac{DWAT}}. 


Our primary goal is to inject external knowledge of synthetic children's speech into a pre-trained \ac{ASR} model using Adapters. This approach allows us to preserve the real children's speech knowledge acquired during pre-training while separately modeling the synthetic characteristics within the Adapter modules. Therefore, Adapters serves as a bridge, that can effectively reducing the domain mismatch between real and synthetic speech data during the training of \ac{ASR} models for children using a combination of real and synthetic data. 

In our \ac{DWAT}  methodology, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:overall}, we introduce two additional steps following the standard \ac{ASR} model training with children's data (Step 0).
% Step 1
Step 1 involves the standard training of Adapter modules, as explained in the previous chapter. While keeping the pre-trained \ac{ASR} model parameters fixed, the Adapter weights are trained on the target data, here \ac{TTS} utterances. These Adapter modules are strategically placed after the Transformer \ac{FFN} component. The goal is to learn a projection that aligns synthetic children's speech with real children's speech within each Transformer layer. This approach allows the model to retain knowledge about children's speech, while the Adapters aim to capture the synthetic characteristics of the different \ac{TTS} utterances. This step is crucial, as Adapter modules require this learning process. Without it, the subsequent fine-tuning in Step 2 could be more challenging and less effective.

%Step2
In Step 2, we fine-tune both the Adapters trained in Step 1 and the entire pre-trained \ac{ASR} model using a mix of synthetic and real data. A pivotal aspect of our approach lies in how we handle data flow within the model. Real samples bypass the Adapter modules as they do not need further adjustments, directly passing through the original \ac{ASR} model components. In contrast, synthetic data goes through the Adapters for necessary modifications to better align with real children's speech characteristics. This differential treatment of data optimises Adapter usage, potentially enhancing the overall performance of the \ac{ASR} system.

% Inference
During the inference phase, the Adapter modules become unnecessary and are discarded since the test data only contains real samples and the training is already complete. It is essential to note that Steps 1 and 2 can be iteratively repeated with newly generated synthetic data. However, it's important to highlight that this aspect is not thoroughly investigated in this work and serves as a subject for future research. The potential iterative repetition of these steps could provide insights into the adaptability and generalisation capabilities of the proposed Double-Way Adapter Tuning methodology.

% Recap
In summary, our proposed approach use Adapter modules to enhance the performance of a pre-trained \ac{ASR} model through the incorporation of synthetic data augmentation. This innovative methodology, known as \ac{DWAT} introduces a two-step process involving the training of Adapter and subsequent fine-tuning with a mix of synthetic and real data in order to bridge the domain gap between real and synthetic children's speech.


\section{Overview of the automatic speech recognition and text-to-speechs systems}
\label{section:SOA}
\subsection{Transformer architecture for ASR}

In our experiments, we employed the SpeechBrain toolkit \cite{speechbrain} for the \ac{ASR} component of our system, using a pre-trained Transformer model\footnote{https://huggingface.co/speechbrain/asr-transformer-transformerlm-librispeech}. This model has trained on the LibriSpeech dataset \cite{librispeech} and comprises 12 Encoder layers and 6 Decoder layers, each with a dimension of 512. It is noteworthy, that is model is different from the ones used in previous Chapters. A mix of \ac{Seq2Seq} and \ac{CTC} loss where used with respective weight of 0.7 and 0.3. Additionally, we integrated a Transformer language model trained on a 10 million-word transcriptions of Librispeech.

\subsection{Multi-speaker text-to-speech: YourTTS}

\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{imgs/YourTTS.png}
        \caption{Architecture of the YourTTS model taken from \cite{casanova2022yourtts}}
        \label{fig:YourTTS}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

In this work as \ac{TTS} component, we used the pre-trained YourTTS model\footnote{https://coqui.ai/blog/tts/yourtts-zero-shot-text-synthesis-low-resource-languages} proposed by \cite{casanova2022yourtts} based on the  Coqui toolkit. YourTTS is a zero-shot multi-speaker and multilingual \ac{TTS} system that is built upon the \ac{VITS}. It incorporates several novel modifications to enable zero-shot multi-speaker and multilingual synthesis. An overview of the YourTTS architecture is presented in Figure \ref{fig:YourTTS}.
% General description of YourTTS
YourTTS featuring a 10-layer Transformer-based text Encoder with 196 hidden channels. This Encoder, adaptable for multilingual use, employs a 4-dimensional language embedding concatenated with the embedding of each input character. However, for the purpose of our experiment, the model use exclusively the English language. The Decoder comprises four affine coupling layers \cite{45819}, each incorporating four WaveNet blocks \cite{45774} to ensure high-quality speech generation. The model also use the HifiGAN vocoder \cite{kong2020hifi}. Notably, YourTTS adopts an end-to-end approach, connecting the vocoder to the \ac{TTS} model through a \ac{VAE} \cite{VAE}.

To enhance its capabilities as multi-speaker and zero-shot \ac{TTS} system, YourTTS integrates a speaker Encoder, specifically the H/ASP speaker Encoder \cite{heo2020clova}, generating 512-dimensional speaker embeddings for each utterances. This speaker Encoder models is compromising a \ac{CNN} layers, followed by four Resnet layers \cite{targ2016resnet}, a attentive statistic pooling and a output linear layer. These embeddings serve as reference speakers for the model, enabling zero-shot multi-speaker capabilities. To give the model zero-shot multi-speaker generation capabilities, the authors conditioned all affine coupling layers of the flowbased Decoder, the posterior Encoder, and the vocoder on external speaker embeddings. Additionally, a s\ac{SCL} is added to the loss to further enhance the multi-speaker ability of the model. The \ac{SCL} is formally expressed as follows:

\begin{equation}
    L_{SCL} = \frac{-\alpha}{n} \cdot \sum_{i}^{n} cos\_sim(\phi(g_i), \phi(h_i))
\end{equation}
where let $\phi(\cdot)$ is the function outputting the speaker embeddings, $cos\_sim$ is the cosine similarity function, $\alpha$ is a positive real number controlling the influence of the \ac{SCL} in the final loss, $n$ is the batch size and $g$ and $h$ represent, respectively, the ground truth and the generated speaker audio.

The YourTTS model was trained using three languages: English with VCTK \cite{veaux2016superseded}, Brazilian Portuguese with TTS-Portuguese Corpus \cite{casanova2022tts}, and French with the French set of the M-AILABS dataset \cite{mailabs}. This training corpus totaled 229 hours of speech data and involved 115 speakers. For a more in-depth understanding of the YourTTS architecture and training process, detailed information can be found in the original paper \cite{casanova2022yourtts}.


\section{Experimental setup}
\label{section:methods}

\subsection{Real speech corpus}
\begin{table}[h!]
\caption{My Science Tutor Children Speech Corpus statistics}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r|c|c|c}
\hline
 & Training & Validation     & Test   \\ \hline
\# of utterances & 60897   & 10044    & 4079  \\ 
\# of speakers & 566   & 79    & 91  \\ 
\# of hours & 113   & 18    & 13  \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:statistics}
\end{center}
\end{table}
In this study, we used the My Science Tutor (MyST) Children Speech Corpus, referred to as the "Real" set. This corpus contains around 400 hours of speech collected from 1,372 students in grades three to five. It comprises conversations with a virtual tutor spanning eight scientific domains. 
Notably, only 45\% of the utterances in the corpus are transcribed. For our experiments, we filtered out utterances shorter than one second and longer than 30 seconds due to GPU memory constraints. Additional details on the filtered corpora are provided in Table \ref{tab:statistics}.

\subsection{Synthetic data}
% Finetune YourTTS with MyST train set
To address the potential performance gap caused by the YourTTS model being trained solely on adult data and never exposed to children's data, we initiated the process by fine-tuning the YourTTS model using the MyST training set. In this study, two \ac{TTS} systems were developed, each with distinct parameter settings, to examine their respective performances and outputs quality under varying conditions. Two \ac{TTS} systems, TTS$_1$ and TTS$_2$, were developed with distinct parameter settings. The first model, called TTS$_1$, underwent fine-tuning for 250 epochs, focusing without incorporating the speaker Encoder \ac{SCL} loss. In contrast, the second system, labelled TTS$_2$, was fine-tuned for 50 epochs, incorporating the speaker Encoder \ac{SCL} loss. This incorporation should improve the alignment between the generated speech and the reference speaker embedding provided to the model. These variations in training strategies enable a thorough examination of the model's performance and output quality under varying conditions,

% Use randomly selected speaker utterances from the training set, d-vector -> TTS
The first \ac{TTS} model, TTS$_1$, was used to generate 300 hours of synthetic data referred to as \textit{Synth$_1$}. The second \ac{TTS} model, TTS$_2$, was employed to generate a larger volume of synthetic data, up to 1,000 hours, denoted as \textit{Large Synth$_2 $}. To compare the performance of TTS$_1$ and TTS$_2$, a subset of 300 hours was extracted from the \textit{Large Synth$_2$} dataset, called \textit{Synth$_2$}. The full 1,000-hour set was exclusively used to evaluate the impact of different amounts of synthetic data, both with reduced and increased amount.

The speech synthesis process using the YourTTS model demands both a text transcription and a  speaker-embedding vector to generate a synthetic utterance. Therefore, to generate each utterances in both \textit{Synth$_1$} and \textit{Large Synth$_2$}, we randomly selected two utterances from the Myst training set, one designated for extracting the speaker embedding and the other exclusively used for its text transcription. The Myst training set, comprising a substantial 60,897 utterances, resulted in a vast pool of potential combinations, totaling 3,708,444,609. This extensive range of possibilities was strategically harnessed to introduce a deliberate mismatch between the selected speaker embeddings and their associated transcriptions. This intentional large range of possibilities served as a mechanism to infuse novel variability into the synthetic data, thereby introducing characteristics not present in the original real corpus.

The decision to use MyST transcriptions for generating synthetic data was driven by the aim to expose the \ac{TTS} model to the unique transcription style present in the MyST dataset. This style encompasses elements such as "UM" hesitations. By adopting this strategy, we intended to enhance the model's ability to learn and reproduce the specific transcription characteristics of the MyST data.

To ensure the quality of the synthetic utterances in \textit{Synth$_1$} and \textit{Large Synth$_2$}, we extended the approach proposed by \cite{wang2021towards}, which involves using cosine similarity between the speaker embeddings of the reference and synthetic utterances as a data selection criterion. However, instead of using i-vector speaker embeddings, we opted for an x-vector approach and employed a different speaker embedding extractor than the one used by the YourTTS model (to prevent conflicts with the \ac{SCL} loss). Specifically, we used a pre-trained x-vector extractor trained on VoxCeleb\footnote{https://huggingface.co/speechbrain/spkrec-ecapa-voxceleb}. During the generation process, we applied a cosine similarity threshold of 0.75 to discard all poorly generated synthetic utterances. While exploring data selection mechanisms, we considered the rejection sampling method suggested by Synth++ \cite{hu2022synt++} but found it unsatisfactory, ultimately opting for speaker-embedding similarity as the selection criterion. To comprehensively evaluate the impact of this data selection, we also created \textit{Unfiltered Synth$_1$} and \textit{Unfiltered Synth$_2$}, two 300-hour corpora of synthetic data generated without using speaker embedding data selection, created with TTS$_1$ and TTS$_2$, respectively.

\subsection{Experiments}
We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of our \ac{DWAT} approach through a series of experiments, comparing it with existing methods. We started the process with baseline models, fine-tuning an pre-trained adult model to children's speech using \textit{Real} data for 20 and 25 epochs (referencing step 0 in Figure \ref{fig:overall}). Subsequently, we evaluated the performance of \ac{TTS} models using only \textit{Synth$_1$} and \textit{Synth$_2$} data. To understand the impact of data filtering, we compared these models trained on filtered data with the unfiltered versions \textit{Unfiltered Synth$_1$} and \textit{Unfiltered Synth$_2$}. Additionally, we considered the combination of these synthetic datasets with \textit{Real} data. These models underwent training for 20 epochs.

We also explored the application of double-way normalisation, inspired by Synth++ \cite{hu2022synt++}. In one scenario, we fine-tuned the adult model for 20 epochs using a mix of filtered synthetic and real data with double-way normalisation (\textit{Norm double-way from adult} in Table \ref{tab:res}). In another scenario, we trained the double-way normalisation model for 5 epochs with the baseline model as initialisation, referred to as \textit{Norm double-way from children}.

Finally, we implemented our \textit{\ac{DWAT}} approach, training the models for 5 epochs with the baseline model as initialisation. Various hyper-parameter configurations will be explored in section \ref{section:exp_DWAT}.

\caption{Results of the different approaches (in WER).}
\label{tab:res_DWAT}
\end{table}

% Baseline
Table \ref{tab:res_DWAT} present the results of the various approaches. The baseline models, obtained by fine-tuning an adult model on children's speech using \textit{Real} data, achieved a \ac{WER} score of 12.99\%. However, extending the training to 25 epochs resulted in an overfitting and a subsequent reduction in performance score with 13.15\% \ac{WER}.
Moving to the impact of incorporating unfiltered synthetic data, denoted as \textit{Unfiltered Synth$_1$} and \textit{Unfiltered Synth$_2$}, as opposed to their filtered counterparts \textit{Synth$_1$} and \textit{Synth$_2$}, in conjunction with \textit{Real}. We observed that the inclusion of filtering presented a notable 2\% enhancement in \ac{WER} when compared to the unfiltered counterparts. However, relying solely on filtered \ac{TTS} speech (\textit{Synth} alone) without any \textit{Real} data, resulting in a substantial 40\% \ac{WER} on the \textit{Real} test set for both TTS$_1$ and TTS$_2$. This discrepancy underscored the considerable domain mismatch between real and synthetic data, signaling the imperative need for further approaches to mitigate this gap.
Furthermore, we delved into a two-step adaptation process where we initially fine-tuned the adult model using only \textit{Synth} data, followed by a subsequent fine-tuning with \textit{Real} data. However, the results indicated a slight decrease in performance in both cases, with \ac{WER} scores of 13.49\% and 13.46\%, respectively. This decline could be attributed to the gap between the characteristics of \ac{TTS} data which may be bigger than the original adult data.

% Double-norm 
During our experiments, the use of double batch normalisation proved ineffective in enhancing the baseline model's performance. Instead, it led to a 5\% relative decrease in \ac{WER} performance when evaluated with the baseline model as initialisation (from children). When training from the adult model, the results were consistent  with the baseline models, with no observed improvement. These results underscore the limitations of double batch normalisation in addressing the domain mismatch between real and synthetic speech data within a Transformer model. This highlights the importance of exploring alternative strategies to effectively bridge the gap.

% Adapter Double-way
Our proposed \ac{DWAT} approach, initiated with the baseline model (step 0 in Figure \ref{fig:overall}), emerged as the most effective among all methods examined. It demonstrated a notable 4\% and 5\% relative improvement in \ac{WER} over the baseline when evaluated on \textit{Synth$_1$} and \textit{Synth$_2$} respectively. This outcome highlights the efficacy of our approach compared to longer training on the \textit{Real} set, showcasing its potential in mitigating the challenges posed by domain mismatch in the context of Automatic Speech Recognition systems.

\end{table}

%Time experiments
Given the potential of our approach to generate a theoretically "infinite" amount of \ac{TTS} data, our primary objective is to conduct a comprehensive exploration of the impact of varying data quantities on the efficacy of the \ac{DWAT} approach. To achieve this, we assess the influence of different quantities of synthetic data from \textit{Large Synth$_2$}, as detailed in Table \ref{tab:hours}.
The findings from our investigation reveal that utilising a small quantity of synthesised speech, ranging from 10 to 50 hours, results in limited improvements in \ac{ASR} performance. Conversely, an excessive volume of \ac{TTS} data, spanning from 600 to 1,000 hours, has the potential to introduce undesirable noise into the system. Consequently, achieving an optimal equilibrium, typically within the range of 100 to 300 hours, becomes crucial. This balance aims to enhance robustness in \ac{ASR} performance while concurrently preventing the introduction of excessive noise, thereby maximising the effectiveness of the \ac{DWAT} approach.

\caption{Results of the different configurations of Adapter double-way approach on 300h of \textit{Synth$_2$}}
\label{tab:config}
\end{table}
To thoroughly evaluate the robustness of our approach, we conducted experiments with the \ac{DWAT} in various configurations. This comprehensive analysis involved exploring different Adapters's bottleneck sizes, ranging from 64 to 2048, varying the number of training epochs (5 and 20), investigating the integration of Adapters in the Decoder of the transformer model, and performing an ablation study by skipping step 0 and both step 0 and 1 in the \ac{DWAT} process.

% Best config
The summarised results in Table \ref{tab:config} provide insights into the optimal configuration, revealing that the most effective setup uses Adapters with a size of 1024 in the Encoder only, coupled with 20 training epochs. This configuration resulted in a remarkable 6\% relative \ac{WER} reduction compared to the baseline. Notably, all configurations demonstrated superior performance to the baseline, underscoring the overall effectiveness of our \ac{DWAT} approach.

Our observations indicate that extended training periods were particularly advantageous for larger Adapter bottleneck sizes, demonstrating no signs of overfitting. Moreover, the integration of Adapters into the Decoder did not lead to a significant improvement in results. This outcome can be attributed to the higher acoustic variability and the fact that the same transcriptions from the Myst dataset were used for synthetic speech utterances. Lastly, skipping step 0 (pre-training) did not result in a significant degradation in performance. However, when both step 0 and step 1 (pre-training and Adapter pre-training) were skipped, performance degradation occurred, underscoring the critical role of Adapter pre-training phase (step 1) in achieving good performances.

Building upon the favorable results observed in previous chapters, which indicated that the Conformer model outperformed the regular Transformer for \ac{ASR} tasks, the effectiveness of Adapters in Conformer and  considering that Synth++ \cite{hu2022synt++} was originally designed for the Conformer architecture, we decided to evaluate our \ac{DWAT} within the Conformer architecture. Given that the TPA configuration of Adapters proved to be the most effective, we chose to implement it in our \ac{DWAT} for the Conformer architecture. The \ac{DWAT} with TPA is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:TTS_conformer}.

In this experiment, we employed the same pre-trained adult Conformer model used in previous chapters. This model comprises 12 layers of Conformer layers for the Encoder, followed by 6 Transformer layers for the Decoder, all with a hidden dimension of 512. The language model used is consistent with the experiments conducted with the Transformer model in the previous sections. Motivated by the insights gained from the exploration of hyperparameters in section \ref{sec:hyperparameter}, we opted for Adapters of size 512 in the Encoder only, using the TPA configuration. In term of training, Step 0 and step 1 were trained for 30 epochs while step 2 only used 10 epochs.

The results obtained from the extension of \ac{DWAT} experiments using the Conformer architecture are presented in Table \ref{tab:DWAT_conformer}. The frozen adult model, referred as the Adult model, achieved a \ac{WER} score of 21.75\%. When considering only real data (Real only), the \ac{WER} score improved significantly to 12.28\%. Which is already outperforming the best results of the Transformer.

When using unfiltered synthetic data alone (\textit{Unfiltered Synth$_2$}) method, it resuted in a higher \ac{WER} score of 37.85\%, showcasing, once again, the mismatch between synthetic and real data. However, when combined with real data (\textit{Unfiltered Synth$_2$} + \textit{Real}), the result are close to the real baseline with a \ac{WER} score of 12.30\%. Similarly, using the filterd \textit{Synth$_2$} alone resulted in a \ac{WER} score of 31.72\%, but when combined with real data (\textit{Synth$_2$} + \textit{Real}), the \ac{WER} score decreased significantly to 12.02\%. This differ from the results observed in the Transformer architecture, as data filtering improved the \ac{WER} score compared to the baseline.
Similarly to the Transformer, the two-step adaptation method yielded a \ac{WER} score of 12.51\%. 

Further insights into the performance of the more sophisticated methods are provided in the context of the Conformer architecture. Specifically, the Synth++ method, which incorporates separated batch normalisation within each Convolution module for \ac{TTS} data, achieved a \ac{WER} score of 11.80\%. This contrasts with the results observed in the Transformer experiment, highlighting the efficiency of this approach specifically within Conformer models. In the other hand, the \ac{DWAT} method consistently outperformed all other methods, showcasing a remarkable \ac{WER} score of 11.64\%. These findings emphasise the effectiveness of both the Synth++ and \ac{DWAT} methods in enhancing the Conformer architecture's performance on the given task.

It is important to highlight that while both Synth++ and \ac{DWAT} demonstrate efficacy within the Conformer setup, the \ac{DWAT} approach consistently outperforms other methods in both Transformer and Conformer configurations. This consistent superiority underscores the relevance and robustness of the \ac{DWAT} approach in improving the overall performance of the models across different architectures.

In summary, the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging synthetic data, real data, and advanced adaptation methods within the Conformer architecture. The \ac{DWAT} method, in particular, stands out as the most successful approach in minimising the \ac{WER}.


\section{Summary and discussion}
\label{section:conclusions_TTS}

In this chapter, we aimed to answer to the following research questions: \textit{Is it possible to use children's synthetic speech to extend the amount of children's data? How can we control the quality and speakersâ€™ variability?}

% Summary 
We provide positive responses to both research questions through the introduction our a novel methodology: the Double way Adapter Transfer procedure, which combine Adapters and synthetic data augmentation for children's speech recognition. Our two-phase training strategy consist of the initial training of Adapter modules using synthetic data, followed by the fine-tuning of Adapters and the entire model weights using a hybrid dataset comprising both synthetic and real data. This distinctive dual-pathway approach resulted in notable improvement over baseline and previous techniques across various configurations. Importantly, our approach demonstrated robustness across different \ac{ASR} architectures, \ac{TTS} model fine-tuning parameters, Adapter sizes, number of epochs, and varying amounts of synthetic data. Furthermore, our study showcases the controllability of \ac{TTS} output quality without necessitating direct modifications of the \ac{TTS} model. This filtering process, performed before applying the \ac{DWAT}, is achieved through the use of pre-trained x-vectors speaker embeddings and cosine similarity metrics between reference and generated utterances. This approach, improved from previous work which only used i-vectors \cite{wang2021towards}, allows the use of synthetic data which align more closely with desired characteristics of real children's speech, contributing to a more controlled augmentation process.

% Discussion
The promising performances observed with the \ac{DWAT} pave the way for future research avenues. One potential avenue involves adopting an iterative methodology, dynamically incorporating newly generated \ac{TTS} data while adjusting the proportion of real data. This iterative fine-tuning approach could potentially provide further insights into the interaction between synthetic and real data, offering opportunities to refine and optimise the training process for improved children's \ac{ASR} models.
Another avenue for exploration could extend the \ac{DWAT} framework to domains beyond the synthetic and real speech data. Investigating the adaptability and effectiveness of \ac{DWAT} in diverse domains. In the context of children's \ac{ASR}, the adult and children's speech domain could be an interesting first step towards this direction.
Furthermore, considering the rapidly evolving landscape of \ac{PETL} approaches, the exploration of new modules as replacements for Adapters represents an new research direction. To this end, in the upcoming chapter, we delve into a comprehensive evaluation of various \ac{PETL} alternatives, aiming to identify novel strategies for enhancing children's \ac{ASR} systems.
